# What is Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly Detection or Outlier Analysis is a step in Data Mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset’s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.

# What is an Anomaly?
With all the analytics programs and various management software available, it’s now easier than ever for companies to effectively measure every single aspect of business activity. This includes the operational performance of applications and infrastructure components as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) that evaluate the success of the organization. With millions of metrics that can be measured, companies tend to end up with quite an impressive dataset to explore the performance of their business.

Within this dataset are data patterns that represent business as usual. An unexpected change within these data patterns, or an event that does not conform to the expected data pattern, is considered an anomaly. In other words, an anomaly is a deviation from business as usual.

But then what do we mean by “business as usual” when it comes to business metrics?  Surely we don’t mean “unchanging” or “constant;” there’s nothing unusual about an eCommerce website collecting a large amount of revenue in a single day – certainly if that day is Cyber Monday. That’s not unusual because a high volume of sales on Cyber Monday is a well-established peak in the natural business cycle of any business with a web storefront.

Indeed, it would be an anomaly if such a company didn’t have high sales volume on Cyber Monday, especially if Cyber Monday sales volumes for previous years were very high. The absence of change can be an anomaly if it breaks a pattern that is normal for the data from that particular metric. Anomalies aren’t categorically good or bad, they’re just deviations from the expected value for a metric at a given point in time.
